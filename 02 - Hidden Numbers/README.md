# Challenge 2

## Hidden numbers

The Nazi air force is trying to transmit numbers (maybe representing army units or available stock) over the radio and
the Enigma code has just been broken, so they try to find out a pen and paper solution to send those numbers in a sort
of secret manner. They decide to encode them on an arbitrary base using arbitrary symbols to represent the number. The
good thing is that we only care about the order of magnitude of such numbers and their minimum and maximum possible values.

You're given a string with characters a-z representing a number. You don't know for sure what base it's in and what
digit on that base each character represents. But you know, however, that all digits in the base are present just one
time in the input string.

You have to calculate the difference between the minimum and maximum possible values. Bear in mind that the numbers
never have leading zeroes.

**Input**

The first line has one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. For each case, there is a line with a string of
lowercase characters, S.

**Output**

For each line, output “Case #x: ” followed by the difference between the minimum and maximum possible values, as a
decimal value.

**Limits**

2 ≤ **length(S)** ≤ 26

**Sample input**

3 <br />
bfd <br />
xwyz <br />
qwerty <br />

**Sample output**

Case #1: 10 <br />
Case #2: 153 <br />
Case #3: 36445 <br />

In the first case (bfd), these are all the possibilities and their values

| Number  | Decimal value |
| :-----: |:-------------:|
| 102     | 11            |
| 120     | 15            |
| 210     | 21            |
| 201     | 19            |


The maximum value is 21 and the minimum is 11, so the solution is 10. Remember that numbers with leading zeroes are not
allowed, so both 012 and 021 are not valid.
